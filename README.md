This mod adds new items (equipment and scrap)

## Emergency Die

This is an item you can buy from the store.
It is a one time use only die, which teleports you to the ship with all your items.
But, not always.

* Rolling 6 will return you to the ship with all the crewmates standing near you (they need to be very close).
* Rolling 4 or 5 will return you to the ship.
* Rolling 3 will cause a mixed effect.
* Rolling 2 will cause something bad to happen.
* You don't want to roll a 1.

## The Gambler

![](https://i.imgur.com/J6biRWU.png)

A new scrap item with rolling outcomes similar to the Emergency die,
but with a larger pool of postivie effects and a bigger chance for a bad outcome.

* Rolling 6 will cause a Great effect.
* Rolling 5 will cause a Good effect.
* Rolling 4 will cause either a Good or a Mixed effect.
* Rolling 3 will cause a Bad effect.
* Rolling 2 will cause either a Bad or an Awful effect.
* Rolling 1 will cause an Awful effect.

You can either sell it, or use it.

## Chronos

Similar to The Gambler. Has a higher chance of getting a great effect,
but the outcomes change when the time passes. As the night
comes, the chances to roll a bad/awful effect increase.

It's probably better to use it earlier in the day, but this can
make your whole day troublesome.

* Rolling 6 will cause a Great effect.
* Rolling 5 will cause a Good or a Great effect.
* Rolling 4 will cause either a Bad, Good or a Great effect.
* Rolling 3 will cause a Bad effect.
* Rolling 2 will cause either a Bad or an Awful effect.
* Rolling 1 will cause an Awful effect.

You can either sell it, or use it.

## The Sacrificer

Guarantees a return to the ship, and a bad/awful effect.

* Rolling 6 will cause a Bad effect.
* Rolling 5 will cause a Bad effect.
* Rolling 4 will cause a Bad effect.
* Rolling 3 will cause a Bad or an Awful effect.
* Rolling 2 will cause an Awful effect.
* Rolling 1 will cause two Awful effects.

## The Saint

This one will never roll a bad or an awful effect.
It's the rarest die in this mod, so don't expect to see it a lot.

* Rolling 6 will cause a Great effect.
* Rolling 5 will cause a Great effect.
* Rolling 4 will cause a Good effect.
* Rolling 3 will cause a Good effect.
* Rolling 2 will cause a Good effect.
* Rolling 1 will waste the die.

## Rusty

Spawns scrap. Only scrap. Higher rolls mean more scrap.
Has negative outcomes.

* Rolling 6 will spawn 7-8 scrap.
* Rolling 5 will spawn 5-6 scrap
* Rolling 4 will spawn 3-4 scrap.
* Rolling 3 will spawn 1-2 scrap.

### Config
Be sure to check out the plugin's config file.
It is called Emergency Dice.cfg and it should
be generated when you run the game with the mod for the first time.

You can modify which effects you want or not, or change some other settings.

The [Allowed Effects] tab in the config syncs with all the clients,
meaning that only server needs to disable/enable effects.

Spawn rates are also serverside only, so no need to worry about having everyone
syncing up their values with the host.

### Emergency die shop alias
Some mods (like Lethal Things mod) might use conflicting item names in the shop.
To solve this I added few aliases for the emergency die in the shop.

Try these aliases in the shop:
* emergencydie
* dice
* die
* edie

### Chat commands
I included some chat commands in the mod, mainly for myself to ease debugging.
If you want to use them you have to set

"Allow chat commands = true"

in the config.

To spawn dice use:
* ~edice dice num

where num is an id of the die.
ID's start from 1.

If you want to force an effect, use
* ~edice effect effectName

You can find effectNames on github in the source code.
Look for the folder named Effects, and inside you will find all of them.
Pick the one you want, and get the name from the line

public string Name => ""
